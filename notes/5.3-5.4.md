### 5.3 - Computing Bias

- Sometimes programs can exclude specific groups or people, purposefully or not
- Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:
   - Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (rich / poor, male / female)
   - Technical: technical contrainsts and considerations (better or worse computers, more or less resources to work with)
   - Emergent: Arises in context of use (e.g. Android turns out to have better app options than iOS)

Actions:
1. What caused the program to react this way?
2. I think that this was unintended, as there is almost no chance such a racist feature would be added into a program worked on multiple programs developed for HP, one of the most well known tech companies in the world.
3. If I was the one making or working on this program, I would have sure to test it with multiple faces (age, gender, race, etc.) It's honestly surprising that such a well known company as HP could have slipped up in something as simple (but impactful) as this.

### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing

- Obtain shared information and share information with others through programming
- Example being Wikipedia, APIs, Cryptocurrency, etc.
- Crowdsourcing can help if you have limited resources or if you need multiple ideas / perspectives

Actions:
1. For CSP, we could create a modifyable wiki/GitHub page were students can access TPT and TT information and add onto it if they want to.
2. A crowdsourcing idea we could use is a forum where students can help other students with homework or studying.
