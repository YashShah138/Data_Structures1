# Test Prep Study

## CB Sections 5.1 - 5.6


### 5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects

- Programs can be beneficial, but can also be used in harmful ways (Drones can be used to drop bombs and do unethical surveillance)
- Computing can have negative health effects (dopamine spikes, addiction, etc.)
- Flowcharts & Unified Modeling Language - different styles of coding, used to model procedures (what they will do). 

Actions:
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   1. Beneficial
      1. We can further education
      2. Drones can help us take amazing aerial photos and videos
      3. We can learn more about the universe
   1. Harmful
      1. Computing can be used to take advantage of some people
      2. Drones can be used to transport drugs
      3. Computers can be used to violate peopleâ€™s privacy
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
 - Dopamine issues are a real problem in our lives. Dopamine is created when we are addicted to something because our brains think that it creates happiness. Dopamine issues are real, as we see in some gamers. Mr. Mortensen gave the example of Anthony Roser. Addiction to gaming can cause anxiety and exhaustion. I think sleeping is a major thing that is impacting my personal study. I usually will take naps during the day and stay up late to finish my homework.

- I understand the concern about dopamine and things like video games, but I think that if you have self control it won't be a problem. I have never missed school or had my grades suffer because of games or sleep.

### 5.2 - Digital Divide

- Not all people have access to the internet or computer programs because of where they live or their financially stability
- Can also depend on government - Some governments regulate the access to technology for their citizens, such as North Korea.
- Coders and programers should have digital divide in mind when creating or working on computer software

Actions: 
1. Empowering yourself in the digital world means to give yourself the correct resources and materials to thrive and reach your full potential.
2. People who are empowered can help others by teaching them what they have learned or donating the materials needed for others to succeed as they once did.
3. I think that red tape increases the digital divide because it slows down or stops the rate at which people with less technological opportunites can reach the same level of understanding or knowledge that others can and may hold back people from reaching their full potential.

### 5.3 - Computing Bias

- Sometimes programs can exclude specific groups or people, purposefully or not
- Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:
   - Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (rich / poor, male / female)
   - Technical: technical contrainsts and considerations (better or worse computers, more or less resources to work with)
   - Emergent: Arises in context of use (e.g. Android turns out to have better app options than iOS)

Actions:
1. What caused the program to react this way?
2. I think that this was unintended, as there is almost no chance such a racist feature would be added into a program worked on multiple programs developed for HP, one of the most well known tech companies in the world.
3. If I was the one making or working on this program, I would have sure to test it with multiple faces (age, gender, race, etc.) It's honestly surprising that such a well known company as HP could have slipped up in something as simple (but impactful) as this.

### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing

- Obtain shared information and share information with others through programming
- Example being Wikipedia, APIs, Cryptocurrency, etc.
- Crowdsourcing can help if you have limited resources or if you need multiple ideas / perspectives

Actions:
1. For CSP, we could create a modifyable wiki/GitHub page were students can access TPT and TT information and add onto it if they want to.
2. A crowdsourcing idea we could use is a forum where students can help other students with homework or studying.

### 5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns

- Companies and teams use different licenses when publishing their work
- Linux: free for use to the public, Open Source
- Qualcomm: makes money on patents, not possible with same license as Linux
- Always cite sources (code, images, etc.)
- Businesses need to make money, but won't last without open source software


Actions:

1. I think that if I wanted to make a profit off of my projects, I would use something like the Open Source MIT license, which would allow me to sell closed source versions of it. If I wanted my projects to be available to everyone and free to use, I would use Creative Commons 0 or GPL.

2. The license I have chosen for my personal GitHub pages is GNU GPLv3, because I want people to be able to use the information I provide without having to pay for it. Since this material is educational, I want people to easily access it, which is easiest to do with GPL. This license also allows people to modify or add on to my project, and also make those projects open source and free to use by other people.

### 5.6 - Safe Computing

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Information about you on the internet, some of it good, other info can be harmful
- Good: Name, email, accomplishments, credit report, etc.
- Bad: passwords, SSN, tax records, Address, etc.
- Use things like 2-Factor authentication to stay safe, beware malware, phishing, etc
- Encryption (symmetric and asymmetric) help keep information and data access off the web

Actions:

1. PII that we include in our CSP projects is our names, what school we go to, our previous projects/assignments.
2. I think that I am not very exposed, there is little to no bad PII on the web.
3. A good password is long, random, and uses alphanumerics and special symbols. A bad password is short and easy to guess.
4. Symmetric encryption only uses 1 (private) key, and is faster but less secure. Asymmetric encryption is a more modern method that uses 2 keys (public and private), which takes longer but is more secure.
5. When we deploy, we encode private information about the machine and user that made the deployment, such as IP address.
6. An example of a phishing method would be if someone sent you an email disguised as a bank official and asked you to verify your bank information. Another example would be if someone called you pretending to be an IRS officer asking you to provide payment of your "missed taxes" through gift cards.
